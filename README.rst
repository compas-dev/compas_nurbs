This package is inspired by the NURBS-Python_ package, however uses a NumPy_-based backend for better performance.

``Curve``, and ``Surface`` are non-uniform non-rational B-Spline geometries (NUBS), ``RationalCurve``, and ``RationalSurface`` are
non-uniform rational B-Spline Geometries (NURBS). They all built upon the class ``BSpline``.
Coordinates have to be in 3D space (x, y, z).

Please refer to the Documentation_ for details.
